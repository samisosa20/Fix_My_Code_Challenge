What you should learn from this project:

### [0. Server status](./status_server/)
* I just started a new Flask project and the first thing I’m putting in place is a route for the status of my API (super important for a load balancer implementation).


### [1. My square](./square.py)
* I love geometry! 


### [2. Step 2: User model](./user.py)
* I’m running into a serious problem! 


### [3. Blog access](./blog)
* I finished and deployed my Rails blog but people are contacting me because they can’t access any of my blog posts… Weird, it works for me…


### [4. Never leave the office](./react-blog)
* I’m coming back from 2 weeks of holidays in France and when I arrived at the office, the first words from my marketing co-worker were: “Hi, how was your holiday? by the way, I think I broke the website…”
